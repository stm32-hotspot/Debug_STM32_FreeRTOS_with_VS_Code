# Using VS Code for FreeRTOS™ application debugging

In this project, we will explore how to set up and debug a FreeRTOS™ project for the STM32H753 microcontroller using visual studio code (VS Code). We’ll cover the necessary extensions, step-by-step project creation, and debugging processes, including using the XRTOS view for enhanced debugging capabilities.
For a more detailed explanation of the use case and additional information, please refer to the article: [Using VS Code for FreeRTOS™ application debugging.](https://community.st.com/t5/tkb/workflowpage/tkb-id/stm32-mcus-knowledge-base/article-id/1231).
